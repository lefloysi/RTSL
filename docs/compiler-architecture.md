# RTSL Compiler Architecture

RTSL is compiled by a C++ frontend with a stable C ABI. The runtime, command
line tool, and future editor tooling should share the same implementation.

## Pipeline

The compiler pipeline is:

```text
RTSL source
  -> lexer
  -> parser
  -> AST
  -> semantic analysis
  -> RTIR generation
  -> artifact writer
```

The linker pipeline is:

```text
rtslo/rtsll inputs + rtslm interfaces
  -> symbol and type resolution
  -> RTIR merge
  -> resource/stage metadata resolution
  -> rtsll or rtslp artifact writer
```

Backends consume `rtslp`, inspect its tables and RTIR, then lower to SPIR-V,
HLSL, MSL, or another target format.

## Frontend Stages

The lexer turns source text into tokens and records source offsets. It recognizes
keywords, identifiers, literals, comments, operators, punctuation, and end of
file.

The parser consumes tokens and produces an AST. It should not perform final type
resolution, overload resolution, resource layout, or backend lowering.

Semantic analysis resolves names, validates declarations, checks types, selects
overloads, validates stage signatures, records exports, and creates the semantic
model used by RTIR generation.

RTIR generation lowers semantic AST nodes into typed backend-neutral IR while
preserving source-facing symbol names and debug mappings.

## Ownership Boundaries

The public ABI lives in `include/` and remains C-compatible. Implementation
headers and C++ types live under `src/` or implementation-only subdirectories.

C++ exceptions must not escape any exported ABI function. ABI entry points catch
allocation failures and internal exceptions, convert them to `rtsl_result`, and
return failure handles or status codes.

Compiler objects own their internal memory. Output blobs returned by the ABI are
owned by the object that produced them and remain valid until that object is
destroyed.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics must include a stable code, severity, source file identity, byte
offset, line, column, and human-readable text. The compiler should support both
recoverable diagnostics and fatal errors.

Recoverable syntax or semantic errors should continue when doing so improves
diagnostic quality. Artifact emission only succeeds when no fatal errors and no
blocking semantic errors remain.

Debug metadata is not an optional afterthought. It is emitted into binary
artifacts when enabled and maps functions, symbols, values, and instruction
ranges back to source files and spans.

## Artifacts

The compiler emits `rtslo` for every compiled source file. If the source exports
symbols, it also emits `rtslm`.

The linker may emit `rtsll` for a linked library without required entry points.
If that library exports symbols, it also emits `rtslm`.

The linker emits `rtslp` for a final linked program with entry points and final
backend-facing metadata.

## CLI Responsibilities

The command line tool should support:

- compiling source to `rtslo` and optional `rtslm`
- resolving imports through module search paths
- linking objects and libraries into `rtsll` or `rtslp`
- disassembling binary artifacts into textual RTIR
- assembling textual RTIR for testing and inspection

Exact option names are allowed to evolve while the artifact and semantic model
is still settling.

## C ABI Responsibilities

The C ABI should expose the same logical pipeline:

- create and destroy compiler contexts
- compile source buffers into artifact blobs
- configure module/interface search paths or in-memory interfaces
- create and destroy linker contexts
- add object, library, or module blobs
- link to library or program outputs
- read artifact blobs and diagnostic results

The ABI should not expose C++ types, STL containers, exceptions, or ownership
that depends on C++ destructors in user code.
